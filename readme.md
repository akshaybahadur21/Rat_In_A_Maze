## Rat in a Maze problem
This code helps you to understand the Rat in a Maze problem.


### Code Requirements
The example code is in Java ([version 1.8](https://java.com/en/download/) or higher will work). 

### Description
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more  complex version can be with limited number of moves.
